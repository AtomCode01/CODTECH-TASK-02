# Student Performance Indicator

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop, train, and evaluate a machine learning model to predict student performance based on various factors such as demographic, academic, and behavioral data. This project aims to assist educators and institutions in identifying students who may require additional support and to optimize educational outcomes.

## Key Activities
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Gathered and cleaned datasets containing student information.
   - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) in TASK 01 to uncover trends and insights.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Selected and engineered features such as attendance, grades, and participation metrics to improve predictive accuracy.
   - Applied techniques like scaling, encoding, and outlier detection to ensure data quality.

3. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - Robust code to add multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model for predicting student performance.
   - Fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize the model.

4. **Evaluation and Validation:**
   - Measured performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and RMSE.
   - Validated the model with cross-validation and a test dataset to ensure generalizability.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - Data manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Machine learning: Scikit-learn
- **Tools:**
  - Jupyter Notebook
## Key Insights
- Identified key predictors of student performance, such as attendance, previous grades, and parental involvement.
- Demonstrated that early identification of at-risk students can lead to timely interventions.
- Highlighted the importance of data-driven decision-making in education to enhance learning outcomes.

## What It Measures
- **Academic Performance:** Predicted final grades and overall academic success.
- **Engagement Levels:** Assessed participation and involvement through attendance and activity metrics.
- **Risk Factors:** Identified students at risk of underperforming or dropping out.
